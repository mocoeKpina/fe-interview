## How to Download Dragon Ball Z Raging Blast 2 on PC?
     
To download Dragon Ball Z Raging Blast 2 on PC, you will need two things: an emulator and a modded version of the game. An emulator is a software that allows you to run games or applications that are designed for another platform on your computer. A modded version of the game is a modified version that has been altered or enhanced by fans or developers.

The emulator that we will use is called Xenia, which is an Xbox 360 emulator for Windows. The modded version of the game that we will use is called Dragonball Raging Blast 2 (PC) Demo, which is a fan-made port of the game for PC. Here are the steps to download and play Dragon Ball Z Raging Blast 2 on PC:
     
1. Download Xenia from its official website or from this link. You will need a Windows computer with a 64-bit processor, DirectX 12 support, and Visual Studio 2019 redistributable installed.
2. Extract the zip file and run the xenia.exe file. You will see a window with some options and settings. You can leave them as they are or change them according to your preference.
3. Download Dragonball Raging Blast 2 (PC) Demo from this link. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the rar file.
4. Extract the rar file and copy the content folder to the same directory where you have Xenia. You should have a folder called content with a subfolder called 545408A7 inside it.
5. Run Xenia again and click on File > Open. Navigate to the content folder and select the default.xex file inside it. This will launch the game.
6. Enjoy playing Dragon Ball Z Raging Blast 2 on PC!

## Tips and Tricks for Playing Dragon Ball Z Raging Blast 2 on PC
     
Here are some tips and tricks that you can use to improve your experience when playing Dragon Ball Z Raging Blast 2 on PC:

- **Use a Controller**: The game is designed for a controller, so using a keyboard and mouse might be difficult or uncomfortable. You can use an Xbox 360 controller or any other compatible controller with Xenia. You can also customize the controller settings in Xenia by clicking on Edit > Input.
- **Adjust the Resolution**: The game runs at a native resolution of 1280x720 pixels, which might look blurry or pixelated on some monitors. You can increase the resolution by editing the xenia.config.toml file in Xenia's directory. Find the line that says "resolution\_scale = 1" and change the number to a higher value, such as 2 or 3. This will make the game look sharper and clearer, but it might also affect the performance and stability of the emulator.
- **Save Your Progress**: The game does not have a save feature, so you will lose your progress if you close the emulator or the game crashes. To avoid this, you can use the save state feature in Xenia by clicking on File > Save State. This will create a file called state.bin in Xenia's directory, which you can load later by clicking on File > Load State.
- **Watch a Tutorial Video**: If you have any trouble following the steps above or want to see how the game looks and plays on PC, you can watch this video tutorial by YouTube user UnrealEntGaming, who shows how to download and play Dragon Ball Z Raging Blast 2 on PC.
